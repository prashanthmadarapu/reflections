4. How it makes routes handling easy?
>> With node.js it is very hard to manage routes as it has to be done with nested if's and does not support dynamic routings
>> With express.js, we can use express.get("/route/1", function(req, res) {}) to easily map each route to its own logic.
>> Also, can support dynamic routes using variables in the route which should be prefixed with ":" like "route/:routeNumber/path".
And the variable can be read using req.params.etagenum. This way it can support REST services efficiently.
>> The invalid routes can be handled using express.use(function(req, res, next){});
