Grid based design
Frameworks
Responsive web pages - adaptive design
Grid with 12columns is ideal solution as the screen can be devided into 2/3/4 sections evenly. And more than 12 columns 
might make screen not readable.

Negative space: space around elements

Overflows: when the space available is not enough for the content of the element

Media Queries: 
  Change CSS properties based on device, screen size and also color
  @media
  
normalize.css from google code to have consistent css across browsers
